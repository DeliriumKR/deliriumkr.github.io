The figure previously known as [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|Thandorin, Duke of Ambre]] rose to power over 1,000 years ago during [[The Wild Wars]], where he became the First King of [[Eiraya]].
Prior to [[The Wild Wars]], the conquered world was divided between seven factions which later became the Duchies of [[The Civilized World]]. Each faction existed in a constant state of war with the others, with no end in sight to the conflicts.

[[Ambre]], the First Throne built into the heights of the frigid Northern Ambre Mountains, was one of these Factions.

This was the state of the world when [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|Thandorin]] was born, Son of [[Sera, Duchess of Ambre III]] and heir to her title. At 15, [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|Thandorin]] was forced to take on his mothers role early after she was killed with the majority of her subjects by [[The Wyrde]] during their initial attack on civilization. [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|Thandorin]] was leader only in name, with very few subjects left to protect. The New Duke of Ambre survived, only barely, thanks to the help and healing of a mysterious traveller accompanied by the legendary Queen of the Mountain, . This stranger was [[Sophial Thorne]], the First Dragon Rider, who quickly became [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|Thandorin]]'s staunch ally and second in command in the decades to come.

Being the only leader at the time that knew of [[The Wyrde]] and of their intentions to invade [[The Civilized World]], [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|Thandorin]] quickly realised that all sentient life would fall if it couldn't stand united against this common enemy. And so in the decades that followed, [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|Thandorin]] worked tirelessly to gather allies and unite the Factions, all while desperately fending off [[The Wyrde]] that now attacked every faction on every fronts.
Eventually, after allying every fragmented faction and uncovering [[The Everlyte Crown]] (a legendary Relic that bestows both Nobility and Immortality, used by [[The Ancient Kings]] of [[Old Eiraya]] as a symbol of their right to rule,) [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|Thandorin]] established the New Kingdom of [[Eiraya]] and [[The Seven Thrones]] that served it, ascending as its First King. This event established the [[Era of the Seven Thrones (EST)]] used in the [[Thandorian Calendar]], taking over from the era [[Before the First Ascension (BFA)]].

With [[Eiraya]] united, [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte]] repelled [[The Wyrde]], forcing it back beyond the borders of [[The Civilized World]] before erecting [[The Border Walls]] to keep its forces from invading again. [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|King Thandorin]] established [[The Dragon Aegis]], an order of Dragon Riders made Knights sworn to defend the land of Eiraya from all threats posed to it, with [[Sophial Thorne]] as its first leader. The age of prosperity that followed would go uninterrupted until modern day.

Over centuries, [[The Wild Wars]] faded from public memory and the scars of its damages healed for all but those old enough to remember it. One such soul was [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|The First King]] himself, who as a result of his immortality, ruled uncontested for over 1,200 years. During this time, he had earned a reputation as a fair King able to balance the requirements of the Seven Duchies and their Thrones. 
Most of his subjects considered his time ruling as the Golden Age of civilization, but there are those that disagree.
In the year 1250 EST, during the 5th Millennial Quarter celebration of [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|King Thandorin]]'s Ascension, [[King Thandorin, the First Everlyte|King Thandorin]] was murdered by Supreme Commander Evander, who later became "God Emperor Evander"
