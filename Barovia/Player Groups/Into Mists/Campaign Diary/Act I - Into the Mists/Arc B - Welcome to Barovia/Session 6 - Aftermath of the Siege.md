## DM Notes
---
Ismark survived but the party's opinion of him has soured. They believe he was just trying to kick his sister out. Party have taken a shine to Ireena.
## Player Feedback
---
### Sophie - Scarlet
Dislikes Ismark's character, and is suspicious of him
### Joao - Sir Gus Gus
Has obtained a shield from Ismark as payment for helping with the village. Although its old and rusted, it will break on a Crit against Sir Gus Gus. Has no enmity for or against Ismark, and is solely focused on finding James
### George - Stumpfoot
Dislikes Ismark's character, not trusting him. Player under false pretence that Strahd hides his identity (he does not, as he has no need.)
Is amicable to Ireena and suggested bringing her with us.
### Joanna - Valeria
Following in Scarlet's footsteps. Is more concerned with not being tricked than engaging as a character. This can change after reminding that DM is not out to trick them.
## Recap
---
The party barely have time to catch their breath, before a small, dark silhouette plunged from the skies above, resolving into the form of a familiar raven, its blue-tipped wings flashing in the torchlight. Its eyes were wide and panicked, and an urgent, desperate shriek sounded repeatedly from its wide-open beak.

Terrified shouts in the distance, and the sound of crunching wood coming from the Western Barricade, signify the obvious. Something's wrong.

Steeling their resolve, the party bid farewell to Parriwimple and Bildrath and dash for the sound of danger. After arriving at the source of the noise, the party witness a Plague Spreader approaching the towncenter, where the wounded, lame, and defenceless gather in droves. The only thing standing between it and its slaughter is Ismark, who wrestled with the undead with reckless abandon. Jumping to arms, the party alleviated Ismark's slipping hold on the monster and valiantly struck it down before it could do any harm to the villagers. Scarlet striking the final blow, she split the creature in half with her blade, and allowed a renewed silence to fall back over the village once more.

Tired, wounded, and exhausted, the party heard the sound of hoofsteps squelching through mud. From the shadows on the western road emerged a cloaked man riding an ash-gray horse with dull, shadowed eyes. Behind it trailed a dozen shambling undead, flanking the horseman with six to a side.

The flickering torchlight painted the man’s features in shades of burning orange and red, revealing a tall, lithe figure of dusky complexion, with long, black hair that falls around his elven ears and past his neck. He moved beyond the party, coming to a halt before the town square.

Unfurling a parchment scroll, he exclaimed:

"Five score and seven days past, this people rose in unlawful rebellion against Strahd von Zarovich, Count of Barovia, Master of Castle Ravenloft, and Protector of the Balinok Mountains. For this treasonous act, this settlement has been met with righteous punishment, so that its inhabitants might learn the weight of their defiance.

"Witnessed by the eyes of the dead and damned, this price has been extracted in blood, common and noble alike. Let it be known that on this day, the mercy of Strahd von Zarovich extends once more unto those who return to their fief and field—while those who continue in their folly shall be swept away as chaff before the wind." He then turned to Ismark.

“Please accept my congratulations on your new position—and my condolences on your loss." After delivering this proclamation, they then left, taking their undead group in tow.

The weight of these words hung heavy with Ismark, who made a break for his Father's house in desperation and denial of future grief. The party followed, finding that the Burgomaster's house had been breached by forces unknown in their absence.

A red pool surrounded the burgomaster’s unmoving form, his glassy eyes stared unseeing toward the ceiling as blood dripped from a long, elegant slash across his chest. Not far away, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] lay crumpled across the carpet beneath a boarded-up window, its ragged curtains drifting lazily in the cold wind. Upon investigation, the party found [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] to be dead, and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] unconscious with two puncture marks in the side of her neck. After coming to, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] described to the party returning home during the siege, and seeing the doors of the mansion open. Her father spoke to a stranger in a creepily calm tone, as if someone else was speaking through him. When she locked eyes with the intruder, her mind went blank and she lost consciousness with only a few words from the intruder to lull her into sleep.

“We shall meet again."

The party retreated into the manor, allowing the siblings their grief, before Ismark left to check on the surviving villagers. Ireena invited the party to rest, allowing them use of the spare bedrooms once more, to which they accepted although they insisted on setting up watches to keep an eye on Ireena, who the party concluded was still at risk of being visited by the same intruder who they believed to be the Dread Lord [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. As night passed, Ireena met with Ismark in the kitchen at his request, before breaking into an arguement. Ismark believed that the town of Barovia was no longer safe for Ireena, and he couldn't risk losing her to the Vampire should he return. Despite her initial hearty protest, mention of the [[Barovian Refugees]] and [[Gertruda]]'s disappearance by Ismark played to Ireena's altruistic nature, and she agreed to go. Not to flee, but to help advocate for her people in the face of tyranny.

When the party awoke, Ismark addressed them with three humble requests.

Firstly, Ismark first quietly notes that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] appears to have become a target for both the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] and her fellow villagers, and that he no longer believes [[The Village of Barovia|the village]], which lies directly beneath the shadow of [[Castle Ravenloft]], to be safe for her. He notes that St Andral's Church in Vallaki is said to be hallowed ground, protecting its congregants from vampires and other undead. He believes she might be safe from Strahd here.

He bids the party help him escort [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], located in the heart of the valley, beyond the view of [[Castle Ravenloft]] and (he hopes) beyond the reach of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] knows that moving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is a gamble, since she's vulnerable to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] when she is outside their home, but he has heard assertions from villagers and his father that [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] is well-defended.

Although he can't leave [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] due to his duties as his father's successor, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks the players if they would be willing to bring her to [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D1. St Andral's Church (N1)|St Andral's Church]] in his stead.

Secondly, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s attack on the village has only strengthened [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s belief that the Barovians must find some way of escaping the vampire's tyranny.
"We can't go on living like this," he croaks, his knuckles whitening as he stares into his mug. "I've heard how terrible things were a hundred years ago, before he went to sleep. Vampires lurking in every shadow. Parents and their children disappearing in the night. Rats and wolves and bats reporting our every move to the castle. Even if the Devil goes dormant again in fifty or sixty years' time, who would we be if we condemned our children and grandchildren to that same fate?"

Although he asks them to be discreet in doing so, so as to avoid drawing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s wrath back down upon the village, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks the players to seek the wisdom of Madam Eva, a [[Vistani]] seer and sage who dwells at [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]].
"If anyone might know how the Devil can be destroyed and our people freed," he murmurs, "it's her."

Finally, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks the players to assist him and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] in carrying [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]'s coffin to the church.

After the party agreed, they made their way to the chapel with the siblings in tow, trudging through the grim sight of dead lining the streets. Upon reaching the Church of the Morning Lord, they were greeted by Parriwimple, who mentioned that [[Father Donavich]], the local priest, hasn't welcomed visitors since the beginning of the undead siege. Regardless, the party entered the church.
## Next Session Intro
---
The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments in murmured prayer. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.

The sound of mumbled prayer stops, and a hoarse, tired voice rings through the chamber from the figure kneeling behind the altar.

“I cannot offer the blessing you seek. Go, and leave this accursed place in peace."

The candles around you burn low, their wicks and light dwindling at the edge of darkness hanging on by a thread. The stage returns to you, and you find yourself in-character once more.
