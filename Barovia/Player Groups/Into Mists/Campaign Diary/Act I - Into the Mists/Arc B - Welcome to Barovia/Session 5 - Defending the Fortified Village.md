## Recap

In the din of [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5c. The Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|The Blood of the Vine Tavern]], as its patrons returned to their drinks, the party spoke further with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] regarding the village's undead assailants and growing list of missing persons now including a woman called [[Gertruda]], the daughter of [[Mad Mary|Mary]], and a newfound companion she met that night calling themselves [[James|Sir Gus Gus]]. As the party speculated the implications of having another [[James|Sir Gus]] running around could mean, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] made a request of the party.

“It is getting dark, I imagine it won't be long until the undead try their hand at our throats again. Like it or not, we’re all in this together,"

“I know you have only just arrived, but you look more than capable of fighting off the dead, no? The more hands, the better. I don’t know if I can promise coin, but I can promise it’ll help all of us survive the night—yourselves included. Please, will you help me and my people?"

The party pledged their aid, offering to pitch in where they're needed, and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] gratefully accepted. He informed them that due to the losses they suffered last night the eastern gate, where the party entered the village, would be undefended. To prepare for their night of unending undead, the party travelled to [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5d. The Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)|The Burgomaster's mansion]] to the south of town to meet with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s father, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]], and his sister [[Ireena Kolyana]]. Upon arrival the party discovered a small mob had formed outside; angry [[Barovians]], led by a woman called [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]]. They demanded [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] hand over his fostered daughter, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], citing an old legend that the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] enjoys preying upon red-haired women and such leverage would win them his favour.

The Burgomaster boomed in response “We are Barovians. We do not turn on our own."

[[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] retorted that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] isn’t a true [[Barovians|Barovian]]—after all, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] found her wandering the woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft as a child.
“She’s not one of us, and if you’re going to choose her over us, neither are you."

The party stepped in, defending the [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster]] and his [[Ireena Kolyana|daughter]] in a selfless display. Scarlet and Stumpfoot raised the question to [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]], would she give her own daughter up if it meant an end to the slaughter. To this, she replied that she had already lost family to their foolish effort of defence.
[[Alenka]] told the group that two nights ago her brother, [[Anton Konstantinovich]], and his wife, [[Dezdrelda Konstaninova]], mysteriously vanished in the middle of the night during the siege; their bodies were never found. Their loss has driven [[Alenka]] to grief and paranoia, and given her a desperate need to seek an end to the siege by any means possible.
Brandishing her blade, Scarlet was successful in subduing the mob's impending violence with threat of her own. After a final remark, [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] and her mob retreated back to the village and the Burgomaster invited the party into his home for food, supplies, and their opinion on recent matters.

After an interest in their adventuring career by [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], and an insightful chat with [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]], the party theorised that the Undead could be trying to whittle down the village's spirits in sadistic punishment, lengthening suffering instead of a full-frontal assault. In thanks for their thoughts, the Burgomaster gifted the group a letter of introduction, and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] offered to hand over some supplies for the defence effort in the form of firebombs to which [[Stumpfoot]] gladly obliged.
While waiting in one of the guest rooms for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to produce the goods, he stumbled upon an [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#^ExcerptFromVanRichtensGuidetoVampiresHandout|Excerpt from Van Richten's Guide to Vampires]], which he promptly stuffed into his pocket.

Making small talk, [[Stumpfoot]] learnt of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s thoughts on the recent uprising against the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil Strahd]], and their relationship with the folks that took part. According to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] [[Doru]] was a friend of hers and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], and the son of the village priest [[Father Donavich]].
He was a bright and cheery young man, with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.
Just over three months ago, without warning, [[Doru]] announced a crusade against [[Castle Ravenloft]], which he proclaimed would free Barovia from the [[Mists of Ravenloft|mists]] and return sunlight to the valley. Over two dozen young [[Barovians]] accompanied him, as well as a scholar from distant lands beyond the mists, an outsider just like the party, named [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Alanik Ray]], who had been staying as a guest at their home for the previous several weeks while studying [[Barovians#Barovian Lore|Barovian history]] and ecology.
[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] wasn't able to recall much about [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Alanik]], other than that he was a curious, somewhat intense man who kept to himself, took long walks into the [[#B3. Svalich Woods (C)]], and owned a pet monkey. She does remember, however, that he had a furious argument with [[Doru]] at one point, which confused her when he accompanied [[Doru]] to [[Castle Ravenloft]] shortly thereafter.

With Firebombs unsafely in hand, the group made a stop off at [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)|Bildrath's Mercantile]] for supplies, selling treasures from Death House and haggling for adventuring necessities such as oils and Grappling Hooks before making their way over to the Eastern Barricade.

Alongside [[Bildrath Cantemir]] and his nephew [[Parriwimple]], the party set up last minute defences before holding the line against waves of progressively deadly undead. In the end however, with incredible zeal and martial prowess, it was [[Sir Gus Gus|Sir Gus]] that struck down the final enemy with a full frontal smite!
## Next Session Intro
---
You barely have time to catch your breath, before a small, dark silhouette plunges from the skies above, resolving into the form of a familiar raven, its blue-tipped wings flashing in the torchlight. Its eyes are wide and panicked, and an urgent, desperate shriek sounds repeatedly from its wide-open beak.

You hear terrified shouts in the distance, and the sound of crunching wood coming from the Western Barricade. Something's wrong. In this moment of crisis, the stage returns to you, and you find yourself in-character once more.
