## Next Session Intro
---
Previously; The party made their way into the Church of the Morninglord, seeking there to lay [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]] to rest following his tragic death during the undead siege on the village of Barovia.
There, they met with [[Father Donavich]]; the village priest and father to [[Doru]].
[[Father Donavich|Donavich]] refused his call to a funeral the service, claiming he was no longer fit to lead it.
After being prompted by the party, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] confided that when his son, [[Doru]], left for [[Castle Ravenloft]], he did so with [[Father Donavich|Donavich]]'s Holy Symbol as a token of his love.
When he didn't return, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] assumed the boy dead. In a way he was right, with [[Doru]] returning to him during the opening assault by the undead siege six days ago, now risen by [[Strahd von Zarovich]] as a **Vampire Spawn**.

Distraught and confused, [[Father Donavich]] trapped [[Doru]] in the Undercroft of the church, unable to bring himself to kill him.
[[Father Donavich|Donavich]] admitted to the party in that tender moment that he believes his son to be dead, and that whatever inhabits his son's body is nothing more than a foul imitation.

Ever since [[Doru]] returned, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] has been unable to feel the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]’s presence, cutting him off from his spellcasting. Without his holy symbol still held by [[Doru]], [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] believed he would be unable to restore this connection, that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s foul influence had somehow corrupted his connection to the gods, and that until the foul creature in the Undercroft is destroyed and his symbol returned, the Morninglord's light would not return to him.

Bravely, the party descended into the Undercroft after agreeing to help, expecting to find a hungering monster seeking only to devour them. What they found instead was a broken, guilty man, desperately struggling against a new nature thrust upon him, to avoid hurting those he loves.
In the end, the party was able to help [[Doru]] return to the light and stave off his vampiric nature by allowing him control of his hunger, before returning to [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] successful.

In gratitude for saving his son, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] performed the funeral rites as promised, handing his Holy Symbol to [[Sir Gus Gus]] to help guide him into the light of the Morninglord. With [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] buried, the party spent the rest of the morning resupplying while waiting for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to complete her travel preparations, which she's promised will be completed by noon.

As the dull grey of the late Barovian morning blankets the sky above you in unceasing gloom- [[Scarlet]] and [[Valeria]] - you traverse the cobbles of the dying village back towards the Burgomaster's mansion, your purchases from [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]'s Mercantile in hand. Soon, the sagged edifice comes into sight, it's walls and windows still marked with signs of wear.

Inside, having returned a little earlier - [[Stumpfoot]] and [[Sir Gus Gus|Sir Gus]] - you sit around the burgomaster's table alongside [[Meowth]] and [[Jessie]], organising your packs for the journey. In the quiet tension, you can hear [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] talking in the Entry Hall with a pair of familiar voices. Concern haunts the parts of the conversation you're able to hear.

"..- a few hours searching along and just off the roads. Korga went a little deeper into the Svalich Woods. Not so many undead anymore, as you suspected, but we've also seen no hide, nor hair, of [[Gertruda]]." One of the scouts says.

"I just hope that means she's managed to slip through alive.. Any sight of the Lansten family?" Ismark replies, then a brief silence.

"I see, that's a shame. I'm sure they'll be out there somewhere, lets not give up hope just yet. Regardless, your efforts are appreciated. Any shred of information can help heal Barovian families, something many of them desperately need."

"One last thing, we spotted Ireena dropping from her bedroom window not too long ago. Started heading north short after, just thought after last night you should know."

"That.. I see, thank you. Dismissed."

The two voices then depart, leaving [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] standing in the entry hall as he slowly closes the door. When he returns, concern stains his expression and he turns to you. In this moment, the stage returns to you, and you find yourselves in character once more.
