## Next Session Intro
---
Where last we left our heroes, the party had made their way into the Church of the Morninglord, seeking to lay to rest [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]], following his tragic death during the undead siege on the village of Barovia.
There, they met [[Father Donavich]], the village priest and father to [[Doru]], who was scheduled to perform the rite. [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] was reluctant to perform the service, claiming he was no longer fit to lead it.
After being prompted by the party, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] confided that when his son, [[Doru]], left for [[Castle Ravenloft]], he did so with [[Father Donavich|Donavich]]'s Holy Symbol as a token of his love. When he didn't return, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] assumed the boy dead however, at the beginning of the undead siege six days ago, [[Doru]] returned to him, although he had now been turned into a **Vampire Spawn**.
[[Father Donavich|Donavich]] was able to trap them in the undercroft of the church hoping to discover a way to save his son, but recently has come to believe that his son is already dead, and whatever inhabits his son's body is nothing more than a foul imitation.
Ever since [[Doru]] returned, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] hasn’t been able to cast spells or feel the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]’s presence. He believes that this is because [[Doru]] still has his holy symbol, and that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s foul influence has corrupted [[Father Donavich|Donavich]]’s connection to the gods. Until the foul creature is destroyed and his symbol returned, he believed his magic would not return.

The party descended into the Undercroft after agreeing to help, expecting to find a hungering creature seeking only to devour them. What they found instead was a whimpering boy, desperately struggling against a new nature thrust upon him.
In the end, the party was able to help [[Doru]] return to the light and stave off his vampiric nature and control his hunger, before returning to [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] successful.

In gratitude for saving his son, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] performed the funeral rites as promised, handing his Holy Symbol to [[Sir Gus Gus]] to help guide him into the light of the Morninglord. With [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] now in the ground, the party spend the rest of the morning resupplying while waiting for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to complete her travel preparations, which she's promised will be completed by noon.

As the dull grey of the late Barovian morning blankets the sky above you in unceasing gloom, your feet traverse the cobbles of the dying village towards the Burgomaster's mansion. And as it's sagged edifice comes into sight, it's walls and windows still marked with those same signs of wear, the stage returns to you, and you find yourselves in character once more.
