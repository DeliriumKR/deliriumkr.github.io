_An adventure for five 4th-level characters._

In this arc, the players escort [[Ireena Kolyana]] to [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's Church]] in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], fulfilling their vow to her brother, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]. However, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], the church's priest, informs them that the bones of [[Saint Andral]]—the source of the church's protective magic—have recently been stolen, placing its wards and parishioners at risk.

The players have until the night of their fifth day after arriving in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] to identify the thief (the church groundskeeper, [[Milivoj]]), track down the bones to their hiding place (the [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] coffin maker's shop), and return them to their rightful place in the church. Their mission will bring them into direct conflict with [[Volenta Popofsky]], [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s most sadistic vampiric bride, and her vampiric minions.

Can the players defeat [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]]'s plan and restore the church's protection? Or will the church be lost in darkness and blood, its flickering light snuffed out in the shadows?

> [!example]- An Early Start
> If the players bring [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's Church]] on their first night in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] (i.e., "day zero" in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]), they arrive to find [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] finishing a service to his congregation. After giving reassurances to [[Willemina Rikalova]] (see [[Arc C - Into the Valley]] for more information about [[Willemina Rikalova|Willemina]]), [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] welcomes the players and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to the church and offers his assistance.
> 
> If told that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] hopes to find sanctuary at the church, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is glad to offer her a pallet to sleep on in the chapel. After [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] offers to compensate him for his kindness, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] considers her request, then invites her to assist with [[Yeska]]'s chores and education for the duration of her stay—a request which [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] graciously accepts.
> 
> The following morning, after [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s bones are stolen as described below, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] visits the players at [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|the Blue Water Inn]] before their conversation with [[Urwin Martikov]] described in [[Arc C - Into the Valley]] and asks them to visit the church to speak with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] about an "incident." ([[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] has asked her not to speak of the incident outside of the church, for fear of raising a panic.) The remainder of this arc then proceeds normally.
# D1. St. Andral's Church 

_This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N1._

> [!cutscene] When the players approach the church, read:
> This slouching, centuries-old stone church has a bulging steeple in the back and walls lined with cracked, stained glass windows depicting pious saints. A fence of wrought iron encloses a garden of gravestones next to the church. A thin mist creeps among the graves.

This church is dedicated to the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]] and named after [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]], whose bones once rested under the altar.

[[Father Lucian Petrovich]] (LG male human [priest](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#priest_mm)) oversees the church and does his best to raise spirits. Assisting him is an orphan and altar boy named [[Yeska]] (LG male human noncombatant). A brawny lad with a perpetually furrowed brow named [[Milivoj]] tends the grounds and digs graves.

At night, the church is packed with 2d6 + 6 [frightened](https://2014.5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#frightened_phb) [[Vallakians|Vallakian]] adults (male and female human commoners and 2d6 equally terrified [[Vallakians|Vallakian]] children (male and female human noncombatants). [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] offers his nightly congregation his prayers and the promise of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s protection. Among [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s nightly flock is a sad old woman named [[Willemina Rikalova]]. Her son, the shoemaker [[Udo Lukovich]], has been imprisoned for speaking out against the burgomaster. She prays that her son will be set free.

The church's occupants follow the following schedule unless interrupted:

- At dawn, [[Yeska]] joins [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] for prayers in the chapel and assists him in preparing breakfast.
- In the morning, [[Yeska]] runs errands around [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] while [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] sweeps the chapel, dusts the pews, polishes the altar, and tidies up the kitchen.
- In the afternoon, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] teaches [[Yeska]] how to read, and educates him in basic history and theology.
- In the evening, with [[Yeska]]'s assistance, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] leads the congregation in prayer and delivers a sermon promising sanctuary and comfort.

> [!tip]- The Stolen Bones
> Though he helped [[Strahd von Zarovich|House Von Zarovich]] ascend to power, [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]] ironically remained a fierce and powerful foe of the undead for all his life. As Most High Priest of the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]'s church, [[Saint Andral|Andral]] directed fierce crusades against undead that lurked in the dark places of King Barov's kingdom, rooting them out wherever they could be found.
> 
> So great was his hatred of undeath that, in his final hours of life, [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]] vowed that his resting place would forever be a sanctuary from the forces of darkness. Since then, his bones have been interred in the crypt beneath [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s church, its priests performing an annual ritual at dawn each year on his holy day - the day of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s Feast. So long as this rite is completed, the church remains hallowed ground for an additional year, as described in Bones of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]] (p. 97).
> 
> When [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] awoke from his recent hibernation, his vampiric bride [[Volenta Popofsky]] decided to impress him the only way she knew how: with a wanton display of suffering, carnage, and terror. Where better, she thought, than a gruesome massacre at [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s Church on the night of its most holy feast?
> 
> It was a dark and windy night when [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] paid a visit to [[Henrik van der Voort]], [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s coffin-maker. Finding a macabre pleasure in the setting, and finding the lonely [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] a perfect target for her plots, [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] politely threatened to burn his shop to the ground unless he allowed her to use it as a base for her machinations.
> 
> A terrified [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] soon capitulated, and [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] established a link with the teleportation brazier in [[Castle Ravenloft]]'s dungeons. Using that link, she summoned two feral **vampire spawn**—former members of [[Doru]]'s rebellion driven mad with bloodlust—and a trio of crates filled with grave dirt to rest in.
> 
> A remnant of an older age, [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] knew that [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s remains provided the church with its blessed protection. She commanded [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] to find and steal those bones before the night of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s Feast - by any means necessary.
> 
> Given his profession, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] had encountered [[Milivoj]]—the church's groundskeeper—on more than one occasion. He knew that [[Milivoj]] was familiar with the church's occupants and layout, that [[Milivoj]] thought little of the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]'s faith, and—most importantly—that [[Milivoj]] had a host of younger siblings he was desperate to feed.
> 
> Digging into his own savings for funds, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] approached [[Milivoj]] with a story and an offer. [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]], [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] claimed, was an ancestor of [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s own family—and one whose remains [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] was anxious to claim. "In these darkened times," [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] said somberly, "we all want our families close at hand."
> 
> [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] told [[Milivoj]] his family had searched for [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s remains for centuries—but that only recently had he learned them to be located somewhere in the church. Doubtless, he claimed, the good [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] would be loathe to surrender such a relic, even though their only true value was sentimental.
> 
> That was where [[Milivoj]] came in. In exchange for a payment of fifteen electrum pieces, [[Milivoj]] would find and retrieve [[Saint Andral|Andral]]'s remains. Old legends, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] noted, indicated that those remains carried [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s blessing, sanctifying the church from evil—though he personally doubted they were true. He suggested [[Milivoj]] use those legends, however, as an excuse to inquire about the remains' location, either from [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] or from [[Yeska]], the altar boy. ("Of course," [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] noted with a dry chuckle, "I'm fairly certain I've seen [[Izek Strazni]] entering the church, so perhaps those legends have lost their luster for good cause, eh?")
> 
> [[Milivoj]], eager to secure funds to care for his siblings, was easily convinced to steal those "moldy old relics" and soon agreed to [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s offer. He knew [[Yeska]], a recent orphan, was a timid and fearful child who looked to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] for safety and comfort. Though he couldn't escape the guilt he felt for leveraging the boy's fear, [[Milivoj]] decided that a few nights of [[Yeska]]'s nightmares were a worthy price to pay to ensure his own family had food to eat.
> 
> Six days later, shortly before [[Yeska]]'s lessons with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], [[Milivoj]] wondered aloud in front of the boy whether [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] might attack the church with an army of vampires and demons. "I heard vampires hate the sun," [[Milivoj]] said darkly as [[Yeska]]'s face paled. "And if the Devil came here, what could we possibly do to stop him?"
> 
> When [[Yeska]]'s lesson began shortly thereafter, [[Milivoj]] eavesdropped outside the door—and silently cheered when [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] revealed the bones' location beneath the altar. That same night, a cloaked and hooded [[Milivoj]] returned to the church with his shovel in hand, creeping through the darkened chapel and forcing open the crypt that lurked below.
> 
> But a splintering floorboard betrayed him—and when [[Milivoj]] emerged from the crypt, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] emerged to block the exit. Without recognizing him, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] demanded the intruder reveal his face and relinquish what he had stolen. [[Milivoj]] panicked and fled through one of the church's glass windows, shattering it. [[Milivoj]] then delivered the bones to [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]], who paid him.
> 
> [[Yeska]] doesn't yet know that the bones were stolen. Instead, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] told him only that a broken tree branch had crashed through the window, breaking the glass and damaging the floor. The following dawn, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] sent [[Yeska]] to [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s shop to obtain planks and nails for the repair, which [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] delivered personally to scope out whether [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] suspected his involvement.
> 
> [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] doesn't know who stole the bones or why. Though he gently interrogated [[Yeska]] as to whether he told anyone about the bones, [[Yeska]] truthfully told him that he hadn't. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] has been unable to discern more from his own brief inspection of the crime scene. With the date of reconsecration fast approaching, however, he fears the worst.
## D1a. Entering the Church 
---
When the players first move to enter the church after the bones have been stolen, [[Henrik van der Voort]] emerges at the same time, forcing one of the players to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or crash into him.

Whether the player succeeds or fails, the near-impact makes [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] trip, sending him tumbling to the ground. As he does, he loses his hold on a bundle of nails and planks held in his arms, which scatter across the stairs and earth below. The farsighted [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] also loses his pair of half-cracked spectacles in the fall, which land across the steps a short ways beneath him.

The players can help [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] collect his glasses, nails, and planks as he scrambles helplessly to find them. If they do, he thanks them profusely, dabbing at his face and hands with a slightly soiled handkerchief. He is willing to share the following information if directly asked:

- His name is [[Henrik van der Voort]], and he is [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s resident coffin-maker and occasional carpenter.
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asked him to visit to deliver some tools and supplies to repair some damage to the floor caused by a falling tree branch the previous night.
- His shop can be found at the south end of Arasek Stockyard. "Although," [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] jokes awkwardly, "I do hope you won't need my services too soon."

[[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] then excuses himself and departs to return to his shop.
## D1b. The Chapel 
---
> [!cutscene] When the players first enter this area, read:
> 
> A dozen ornate candelabras bathe rows of well-kept pews in candlelight, casting a soft luminescence that touches every corner of this chapel. At the far end of the room, a wooden altar stands proudly, carved with a proud sunburst with rays thrusting forth in cheery defiance. Six tall windows flank the altar, though one appears to have been broken, with glass shards lining its dark iron pane like jagged teeth.
> 
> A broad-shouldered, black-haired young man stands atop a small stepladder before the broken window, nailing a tarp into place to cover it as a young boy sweeps the chapel floor not far away. A middle-aged priest, with graying hair and crisp, clean vestments watches them work from the pews, holding a broom of his own and looking lost in thought.

The young man is [[Milivoj]], who is as described in N1. [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's Church]] (p. 97). The priest is [[Father Lucian Petrovich]]. The boy is [[Yeska]].

> [!handout]- "Father Lucian Petrovich" by Caleb Cleveland
> ![[Father Lucian Petrovich by Caleb Cleveland.png]]

When the players first meet [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], he greets them warmly, recognizing them as newcomers to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], welcoming them to [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's Church]], and asking if they have come seeking fellowship or to pray to the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]].

After the players have exchanged pleasantries, [[Milivoj]] dismounts his stepladder and returns it to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]. The following exchange then takes place, giving the players generous time and opportunity to interrupt and respond:

- Upon noticing the players, [[Milivoj]] immediately scowls, and asks, "Father, are these outsiders bothering you? I can ask them to leave."
- If the players say nothing, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] chides [[Milivoj]], noting that, "In these dark times, it's never been more important to be hospitable to others."
- If rebuffed, [[Milivoj]] retorts: "You can't be too sure about strangers. I thought the town gates were supposed to be closed. They could be vampires, or worse." He then glowers at the players, and asks, "Unless you have some way of proving that you're not?"

[[Milivoj]] is eager to prevent further investigation of the church, and hopes to persuade [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] to drive the players away. However, he's not willing to look suspicious, and drops the issue if the players or [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] push back. "You can't be too careful," he mumbles. "Be safe, Father." He then departs.

Once [[Milivoj]] leaves, if [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is informed that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is seeking sanctuary in the church from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] or other monsters, he first ensures that no other congregants are present—shooing away [[Yeska]] if present—and swears the players to secrecy.

If the players agree not to spread his words beyond the church, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] sorrowfully informs them that, while he would love nothing more than to extend [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] an offer of permanent shelter, recent events have left the church's wards in a precarious state. He can also share the following additional information at the players' prompting:

- The church is ordinarily hallowed ground, as though the building was protected by a _hallow_ spell. This magical ward prevents fiends and undead from entering the church, and keeps them from magically charming, frightening, or possessing those within it.
- The source of this protection is the crypt of [[Saint Andral]], which has historically held the blessed bones of [[Saint Andral|Andral]] himself, the founder of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s church and a great cleric of the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]].
- Originally, only [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] knew of the bones' existence. However, after news the siege of [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] reached [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] a few days ago, he shared the knowledge of the bones with [[Yeska]] to put the fearful boy at ease, as described in Bones of St. Andral (p. 97).
- To retain the church's protection, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] must invoke a particular rite of protection over [[Saint Andral]]'s bones once every year, at dawn on the morning of [[Saint Andral]]'s Feast—a holy day that memorializes [[Saint Andral|Andral]]'s life.
- If the rite cannot be carried out at that time, the wards will fall until the rite is completed on a subsequent dawn.
- Last night, someone broke into the church's crypt and stole [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s bones, damaging the floorboards behind the altar and escaping through a window. Without the bones, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can't complete the protective rite, and the wards will fall at dawn on the day of St. [[Saint Andral|Andral]]'s Feast.
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is fearful that some fell creature or wicked soul has manufactured this crisis as an opportunity to cause his congregation harm; though the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] is confident that no monsters could breach [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s walls, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] fears that the town is not as safe as it appears.

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can also share the date of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s Feast, which will take place on the fifth day after the players arrived in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. He has not reported the theft of the bones for fear of the distress that the news might cause, and he doesn't want to ruin the burgomaster's festival. He does not suspect [[Milivoj]] of stealing the bones either, having no reason to do so.

If the players express an interest in doing so, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is glad to allow them to inspect the crime scene—having made neither heads nor tails of it himself—and to interview [[Yeska]], so long as they promise to be patient and gentle with the boy.

If the players ask for the identities of other possible witnesses, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] notes that the only other employee of the church is the groundskeeper, [[Milivoj]]. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can give the players directions to [[Milivoj]]’s house, which is located in the northwestern quarter of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] accompanies the players as they complete their investigation, answering additional questions when asked. If the players' investigation takes them beyond the church, he insists on joining them and asks [[Yeska]] to attend the chapel in his absence. (He takes personal responsibility for the bones' disappearance, and—given his connections across the town and his service to the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]—wishes to assist the players in recovering them.)

While accompanying the party, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] fights alongside them, but allows the players to take the lead in social encounters and exploration.

> [!warning]- Father Lucian's Aid
> Without [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s assistance—and, specifically, the damage output and radiant damage provided by his _spirit guardians_ spell and **_divine eminence_** feature—the battle at the coffin-maker's shop in [[D4c. Volenta's Trap]] is nearly impossible. To avoid a TPK, ensure he accompanies the players upon their departure from the church.
## D1c. The Scene of the Crime 
---
[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is glad to lead the players to the location of the crypt if prompted.

> [!cutscene] Read:
> A small pile of fresh wooden boards rests against the altar, a small pouch of nails sitting atop their surface. Not far away, the old wooden floorboards behind the crypt have been pried up and broken, with splintered edges jutting out at odd angles. Between them, a small, dark opening descends into a dark, dusty space.

The fresh boards and nails were delivered by [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]. The opening is barely wide enough to allow one person to enter, and descends into the crypt.

[[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s crypt is a 10-foot-square, 5-foot high chamber beneath the chapel, lying largely beneath the chapel's altar.

> [!cutscene] If a player enters the crypt, read:
> You descend into a small, dark, damp chamber, the walls made of rough-hewn stone blocks stained with age and moisture. At the center stands a lonely stone slab, an empty, circular depression carved neatly into its surface.

The slab held the bones until [[Milivoj]] stole them.

The players can find the following information by investigating the area around the crypt:

- While investigating the floorboards, the players can find a torn piece of gray wool fabric snagged on a nail with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and a line of rust-stained dirt smeared across a floorboard with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

- While investigating the interior of the crypt, the players can find several clumps of earth with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each clump is in the shape of a large bootprint, and contains several blades of pale green grass and white flower petals.

- While investigating the altar or the stone slab in the crypt, the players can find a few strands of dark black hair with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

The fabric was torn from [[Milivoj]]'s shirt as he lowered himself down, and the rust was left when he used his shovel to pry up the floorboards.

The clumps of earth were left when [[Milivoj]]'s boots hit the floor of the crypt. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can inform the players that the petals are from the ramson plant, which grow in several patches in the church graveyard.

The hair is [[Milivoj]]'s.
## D1d. Interviewing Yeska 
---
If the players choose to interview [[Yeska]], [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks them not to press him too hard for information. The boy is still emotionally fragile from the death of his parents three months ago, and [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] doesn't wish to harm his mental well-being over a mere suspicion of danger. ([[Yeska]] doesn't know that the bones have been stolen; [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] has been careful to keep him away from the hole behind the altar.)

If one of the players asks [[Yeska]] whether he has told anyone else about the bones, he truthfully denies doing so. However, if the players ask whether anyone might have overheard his conversation with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], [[Yeska]] shares that [[Milivoj]] was also in the church at that time. ([[Yeska]], though alarmed by the direction of the conversation, can also be persuaded to share that [[Milivoj]]'s tales of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] potentially attacking the church encouraged him to ask [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] about the church's protection in the first place.)

# D2. Milivoj's House

[[Milivoj]]’s house is located in the impoverished northwest quarter of Vallaki, a short walk from St. Andral’s Church.

> [!cutscene] When the players head there, read:
> The muddy road that leads into the town’s northwest quarter is rough and uneven, chilled by a persistent fog that seems to cling to the soaked earth beneath your feet. As you move further from the town’s center, the streets narrow and the houses grow grimier and more dilapidated, the smell of damp wood and mildew filling your nostrils.
> 
> Your path leads you to a leaning, decrepit structure that seems to sag beneath its own weight. Its timbers are rotting, the windows cracked and filthy. At its front, a ramshackle wooden door stands slightly askew in its frame atop a small, mud-spattered porch.

If the players knock on the door, it’s answered a few moments thereafter by Jarzinka, [[Milivoj]]’s mother. 

> [!cutscene] Read:
> 
> The door groans open, revealing a gaunt, glassy-eyed woman standing on the other side. Her hair is matted with grease and hangs in knots across her shoulders, and a painted beaded necklace hangs around her neck, its colors faded and chipped with age.
> 
> Behind her, a trio of young children wrestle and shout as they roll across a cramped living space stuffed with old, threadbare furniture and an old, stained rug. Two other children—a near-adolescent boy with long, shaggy hair, and a freckled girl of similar age wearing cracked, oversized glasses—peer curiously around a pair of overstuffed, patchwork armchairs at the sight of you.
> 
> The woman at the door grunts, her hollow gaze scanning you expectantly.

The children in the armchairs are a twelve-year-old boy named Bogan and a ten-year-old girl named Zondra. The three children wrestling on the ground are named Lazlo (eight years old), Grilsha (seven years old), and Dargos (five years old).

Jarzinka is a woman of few words, and is annoyed because she has just finished the last of her dream pastries. If the players ask to speak with [[Milivoj]], she turns to Bogan and Zondra, then grunts at them. The conversation then proceeds as follows:

- Bogan cheerfully informs the players that [[Milivoj]] is sick and doesn’t want to talk to anyone today.
- If the players succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check or insist that the matter is urgent, Zondra turns and hollers, “Milo! Someone wants to speak to you.”
  
A few moments later, the nineteen-year-old [[Milivoj]] exits a swollen wooden door at the back of the room, with his three-year-old brother Jirko giggling delightedly from atop [[Milivoj]]’s shoulders and his four-year-old twin sisters, Victoria and Vasha, hanging from his biceps.
## D2a. Confronting Milivoj
---
Upon spotting the players, [[Milivoj]]’s face visibly falls, and he gently shakes Victoria and Vasha from his arms and sets Jirko down in Bogan’s lap. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals his body language has grown tense, and that he is shifting uncomfortably. 

As [[Milivoj]] reaches the door, he tersely addresses Jarzinka as “Mother” and gives her a grudging nod. Jarzinka grunts and shuffles away from the door, disappearing into the room from which [[Milivoj]] came.

If the players inform [[Milivoj]] that they want to speak with him about St. Andral’s bones, he scowls, insists that he knows nothing about the matter, and attempts to close the door. A player can prevent him from doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check. (If [[Milivoj]] successfully closes the door, the players can make him open it again by making a sufficient nuisance of themselves, by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, or by forcing the door down with a successful DC 10 Strength check.)

[[Milivoj]] denies any knowledge of the bones or their theft if asked about them outright. However, he claims to have seen a cloaked figure watching the church two days ago from an alleyway. (The description of the cloaked figure coincidentally matches the appearance of [[Ernst Larnak]], [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]]'s spy, though [[Milivoj]] doesn't know Ernst or the nature of his employment.) A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that he is speaking slightly too quickly.

If the players accuse [[Milivoj]] of stealing the bones and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, [[Milivoj]] admits to stealing them, as described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>. Players who confront [[Milivoj]] with evidence from the crypt automatically succeed. [[Milivoj]] can't take the players to the coffin maker's shop himself, but notes that [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can lead them there.

If asked his motive for stealing the bones, [[Milivoj]] shares the reasons described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>:
- [[Milivoj]] admits to passing the bones over to [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] in exchange for money to help feed his younger sisters and brothers.

He can also share that:
- After his father—a former Vallakian guard—was wounded in a recent wolf attack, both of his parents began regularly purchasing dream pastries from the peddler [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] outside of the gates.
- With both parents addicted to [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]]'s wares, [[Milivoj]] sees himself as his siblings' sole means of avoiding total poverty. (If asked, [[Milivoj]] can provide a basic description of the effects of dream pastries, as described in <span class="citation">Dream Pastries (p. 125)</span>.)

If informed that the bones may have been stolen to allow an attack upon the church, [[Milivoj]] dismisses the idea, insisting that the bones are just a "mouldy old relic" and that "he doesn't have time to believe in fairy tales." He can also share that [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] told him the bones were a powerless family heirloom, and that [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] sought to recover them to honour his ancestor.

> [!example]- Milivoj’s Revelation
> If he is later informed that [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s actions were directed by one of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s vampire spawn, and that the theft of the bones could have allowed a slaughter at the church, [[Milivoj]] is overcome with anxiety, horror, and guilt. He prostrates himself before [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] and begs for his forgiveness, offering to exile himself to the Svalich Woods if doing so will make up for the harm he has caused. ([[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], of course, declines, tearfully embracing and forgiving [[Milivoj]] instead.)

## D2b. Departing the House
---
Once [[Milivoj]] has admitted to the bones' theft, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can lead the players to the coffin maker's shop. (He knows the owner, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]], well, and hopes that he can reason with the man.) If the players appear sceptical, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]—who has the statistics of a **priest**—reveals that he bears the holy symbol of [[Tasha Petrovna]]—his ancestor and a mighty follower of [[Saint Markovia]]—and promises them that he is more than capable of defending himself.

If the players suggest reporting the theft of the bones to the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|burgomaster]], [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is reluctant to do so, fearing the possibility of raising a panic. With a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, however, the players can convince [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] to join them in reporting the theft to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]], who responds as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop.** (If the players don't have [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] with them, the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|burgomaster]] refuses to believe that the bones are responsible for the church's divine protection or to assist the players in recovering them.)

> [!example]- Reporting the Theft 
> If the players report the theft of the bones to the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] and he believes them, [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] then dispatches four guards to arrest [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] and retrieve the bones. When the guards show up, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] surrenders without a fight, claiming the vampires forced him to steal the bones. He then tells the guards where the bones are hidden but won't retrieve the bones himself for fear of being killed by the vampires.
> 
> If the players do not accompany [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vargas]]' guards, the four guards gain access to the coffin maker's shop as described in N6. Coffin Maker's Shop, but are slaughtered when they accidentally trigger [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]]'s trap and alert the vampires to their presence.
> 
> One day later, [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] responds by sending [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] to summon the players to N3. Burgomaster's Mansion, where he accuses them of causing his faithful guards to disappear and threatens to exile them from [[Vallaki]]. (The players can win back his good graces by promising to recover the bones themselves.)
# D3. Arasek Stockyard

_This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N5._

Arasek Stockyard is largely as described in N5. Arasek Stockyard (p. 115). However, while [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s wagon is mostly covered by old and faded paint, the Carnival of Wonders sign on its side is brand new and fresh-painted.

> [!cutscene] When the players arrive here, read:
> This large stockyard has several locked sheds along its periphery and lies adjacent to a roomy warehouse. A wooden sign above the front gate reads "Arasek Stockyard."
> 
> Parked at the south end of the stockyard is a sturdy carnival wagon, its colorful paint peeling off. Faded lettering on its sides spells out the words "Rictavio's Carnival of Wonders." A heavy padlock secures the back door.

> [!tip]- Arasek Stockyard
> The stockyard is a general store and a facility where storage sheds can be rented. It is owned by a middle-aged married couple, [[Gunther Arasek|Gunther]] and [[Yelena Arasek]] (LG male and female commoners). They sell items from the Adventuring Gear table in the Player's Handbook that have a price of 25 gp or less, but at five times the price.

[[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] paid [[Gunther Arasek]] and [[Yelena Arasek]] a generous amount of gold to watch his carnival wagon, no questions asked.

[[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] carries the key to the wagon door. The lock can be picked but is rigged with a poison needle trap.

If one of the players expresses an interest in breaking into the wagon, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] discourages them from doing so if he is present.

If a player nonetheless attempts to unlock or force open the door to the wagon, the entire wagon suddenly rocks violently from side to side. The players can also hear the sound of something with large, heavy claws scratching against the interior of the wagon. (The rocking and scratches are made by the ghost of [[Erasmus van Richten]], a **poltergeist** seeking to protect [[Arabelle]] by scaring visitors away.)

If the players successfully break the door to the wagon or pick its padlock, they find that the wagon’s interior contains a soft bed of straw, a comfortable woollen blanket, a few books, and a young Vistana girl—[[Arabelle]]—who is clutching a plush sabre-toothed tiger to her chest and wearing a beaded necklace with a carved copper amulet. (For more information about [[Arabelle]], see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]].)
# D4. Coffin Maker's Shop

_This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N6._

The coffin maker's shop is largely as described in N6. Coffin Maker's Shop (p. 116). However, the crates in N6f. Vampire Nest (p. 118) have been replaced by three coffins packed with grave dirt from [[Castle Ravenloft]], which contain two **vampire spawn** and **[[Volenta Popofsky]]**, one of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s vampiric brides. In addition, players who explore N6f. Vampire Nest (p. 118) find a faded green-tinged pentagram 5 feet in diameter burned onto the floor at the edge of the room, just beyond the vampires' coffins.

> [!tip]- The Burned Pentagram 
> The green pentagram is a remnant of [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]]'s use of the teleportation brazier in K78. Brazier Room (p. 82). If asked, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] doesn't know what it signifies. However, he can share with the players that, one night shortly after he first met Volenta, a sickly green light flashed through the shop, with her two vampire spawn companions exiting from N6f. Vampire Nest (p. 118) shortly thereafter.

> [!cutscene] When the players approach, read:
> This uninviting shop is two stories tall and has a sign shaped like a coffin above the front door. Every window appears to be a latticework of iron fitted with squares of frosted glass that allows little visibility of the inside. All of the window shutters appear closed up tight, and a deathly silence surrounds the establishment.

[[Henrik van der Voort]], the coffin maker, follows the following schedule:

- In the morning, he sleeps in, remaining in bed in **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom**.
- In the late morning, he anxiously checks that the wardrobe containing St. Andral's bones hasn't been disturbed, and then prepares breakfast in **N6d. Kitchen**.
- In the afternoon, he builds coffins in **N6c. Workshop**.
- In the evening, he prepares an evening meal in **N6d. Kitchen**.
- At night, he sleeps in **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom.**
## D4a. Entering the Shop
---
The players cannot access the shop through persuasion, deception, or intimidation; in each case, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] will respond as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop**.

> [!example]- How Henrick reacts to visitors
> If the players attempts to get [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s attention through persuasion, deception, intimidation, or knocking, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] shouts "We're closed! Go away!" without opening the door.
> 
> If the characters accuse [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] of stealing the Bones of St Andral, he shouts again, "Go away! Leave me alone!"
> 
> He then stops responding.

Additionally, note that the windows are locked from the inside and the doors are barred. As such, the players cannot open a window or door by use of _thieves tools_. Instead, the players can enter the shop by either of the following means:

- They can break down one or both of the barred doors with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Doing so alerts [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]], who comes to confront them. (Doing so doesn't alert [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] or the **vampire spawn**, who merely assume [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] has dropped a coffin or other wooden object.)
- They can use magic (e.g., _mage hand_ or _misty step_) to open the windows or doors from the inside. Doing so avoids alerting [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]], who remains in his current location.

In either case, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] offers no resistance as soon as he sees that the players have entered the shop. Instead, he rightfully guesses that they have come to recover the bones and informs them of the bones' location and the danger of the vampire nest, as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop**. In exchange, he pleads with them to protect him from the vampires, who he rightfully fears will butcher him for his betrayal. He won't retrieve the bones alone, but will accompany the players upstairs if demanded.

[[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] does not know that [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] has secretly installed a poison needle trap and tripwire bell in the wardrobe secret compartment where the bones are kept. He assumes that the players will be able to quietly recover the bones, depart the shop, and escort him elsewhere to safety.

> [!example]- Ambushing the Vampires
> 
> Players who attempt to ambush the vampires in N6f. Vampire Nest (p. 118) before recovering the bones must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check to approach a crate without awakening the nearby vampires, and a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check with disadvantage to open it. A woken vampire attacks intruders on sight.
### N6a. Coffin Storage

> [!cutscene] When the players enter here, read:
> Arrange haphazardly about the floor of this musty, L-shaped room are thirteen wooden coffins.

[[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] stores and displays the coffins he has made in this room. All of them are empty.
### N6b. Junk Room 

> [!cutscene] When the players enter here, read:
> A table with four chairs is in one corner of this room, with a lantern hanging from a chain directly above. Two well-made cabinets stand against the east wall.

The cabinets are packed with worthless items that [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] has collected over the years.
### N6c. Workshop

> [!cutscene] When the players enter here, read:
> This workshop contains everything a carpenter needs to make coffins and furniture. Three sturdy worktables stretch the length of the west wall.

[[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] builds coffins and keeps his carpenter's tools in this room.
### N6d. Kitchen

> [!cutscene] When the players enter here, read:
> This kitchen contains a square table surrounded by chairs and shelves of provisions.

[[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] prepares his meals here.
### N6e. Henrik's Bedroom

> [!cutscene] When the players enter here, read:
> This modest bedchamber holds a cot and several well-made pieces of furniture, including a table, a padded chair, a bookshelf, and a wardrobe.

[[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] sleeps here, at night and well into the morning. The bookshelf contains a handful of storybooks and carpenters' manuals that have been handed down from previous generations.

**Treasure.** The wardrobe in the southeast corner has a secret compartment in its base, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] has also set up traps here. Inside the compartment are two sacks—a large one containing the bones of St. Andral and a small one containing 30 sp and 12 ep. All of the coins bear the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich. For more information, see [[#D5. Retrieving the Bones]].
### N6f. Vampire Nest

> [!cutscene] When the players enter here, read:
> This large, drafty room is strung with cobwebs and takes up most of the upper floor. Stacks of wooden planks lie amid several crates marked "JUNK."

The two southernmost crates contain old junk that Henrik has accumulated over the years. The six crates in the northern part of the room are packed with earth and serve as resting places for the six vampire spawn that lair here. If the characters open one of the occupied crates, all of the vampire spawn burst forth and attack.

**Teleport Destination.** Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked T on the map.
## D4b. Recovering the Bones
---
The bones have been concealed as described in [[#N6e. Henrik's Bedroom]]. However, [[Volenta Popofsky]] has added two additional safeguards to the secret compartment:

- a **poison needle** trap (Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 123), which triggers unless a particular wooden panel is pushed before the compartment is opened, and
- a hidden wire attached to the compartment's opening, which connects to a noisemaker at the base of the compartment shaped vaguely like the head of the toymaker [[Gadof Blinsky]], including his jester’s cap and bells.

The poison needle trap can be identified and disarmed as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide (p. 123).

> [!warning]- Which Needle? 
> There are two official poison needle traps in _Dungeons & Dragons_ 5th Edition: the **_poison needle_** provided on page 123 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_, and the **_poison needle trap_** provided on page 114 of _Xanathar's Guide to Everything_. This guide refers to the former, which merely poisons its victim instead of paralyzing them.

> [!tip]- Poison Needle Trap
> A poison needle is hidden within the secret compartment's lock. Opening the compartment without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poisons.
> 
> When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11(2d10) poison damage, and must succeed of a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.
> 
> A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.

The hidden wire can be identified before the compartment is fully opened with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disarmed with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

Opening the compartment without disabling the wire or unsuccessfully attempting to disarm the wire causes the noisemaker to loudly screech, “Is no fun, is no Blinsky!” repeatedly for 1 minute, alerting the vampires in **N6f. Vampire Nest**.

> [!tip]- The Noisemaker
> [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] purchased the noisemaker from [[Gadof Blinsky]] of Blinsky Toys, described further in N7. Blinsky Toys (p. 118), several nights ago. Though tempted to kill him or take the toy by force, Blinsky's affinity for the macabre led [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] to regard him as a kindred spirit, and she elected to spare his life on a whim.

> [!example]- Disabling the Noisemaker 
> If the players successfully retrieve the bones without alerting the vampires, [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] discovers the bones to be missing shortly after she awakens at dusk that night. If [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] is still within the shop, she disembowels and beheads him, then leaves his head staked on a spear leaning against the statue at the center of N8. Town Square (p. 119). In either case, [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] then departs [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] for [[Castle Ravenloft]], slinking back to the keep in shame.
## D4c. Volenta's Trap
---
If the players allow the noisemaker to activate, [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] and her two loyal **vampire spawn** arise to confront them one round later, either by forcing their way into **N6d. Kitchen** or (if the players have already exited **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom**) by obstructing the players' path down the stairs. When the vampires appear, they use their **_spider climb_** to clamber across the walls before dropping down to the players’ level, with [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] crouching upside-down on the ceiling behind them.

> [!handout]- "Volenta Popofsky" by Caleb Cleveland
> ![[Volenta Popofsky by Caleb Cleveland.png]]

[[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] uses the two vampire spawn with her as cover, placing them between her and the players. She then greets them as follows, providing them with an opportunity to respond each time:

- [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] addresses the players as "her Lord's new toys" with amusement and disbelief.
- She claims that they're "less impressive" than she'd expected, and boasts that neither they nor "Ludmilla, Anastrasya, or her Lord's skinny new plaything could hold a candle to her vision." (The "skinny new plaything" is referring to [[Escher]].)
- She insists that the players couldn't stop her scheme if they tried. "Once I make the pews of your little church run red with blood," she raves, "my beloved will recognize the real gem of his realm—_me!_"
- She observes that it's lucky that they're in a coffin shop, adding, "After all, they'll need _somewhere_ to put your parts when I'm through with you." She then directs the other vampires to attack.

> [!combat]- Fight against the First Bride
> Due to the phase mechanic and chokepoint, this is a series of two consecutive **bruising** combat encounters against a party of five 4th-level players and a CR 3 ally ([[Father Lucian Petrovich]]), with each consuming approximately 24% of the players' total maximum hit points (for a total of 48% of their maximum hit points). Adjust the Encounter using the following, depending on group size:

>> [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] retains the statistics of a priest. However, his divine eminence feature has changed from the standard **Priest** statblock as detailed below.
>> 
>> In combat, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] directs the players to form a defensive line around the door, hoping to funnel the vampires one-by-one into a choke point in order to dispatch them individually. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] himself attempts to end his turns behind full cover on each round of combat, ducking out only briefly to target vampires with his offensive spells.
>> 
>> On his first turn, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] uses his action to cast spirit guardians, filling the air with a galaxy of swirling, fiery suns that burn with fierce golden light.

> [!warning]- Sunlight in Barovia 
> Remember that vampires and other creatures in Barovia are unaffected by Barovian daylight, as described in Sunlight in Barovia (p. 24).

> [!warning]- Vampires Aren't Humanoid 
> Remember that vampire spawn, including [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]], have the undead type, rather than the humanoid type. As such, spells and effects that target only humanoids, such as _hold person_, or which can't affect undead, such as _command_, have no effect on [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] and the vampires accompanying her.
### 1. Volenta
[[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] begins combat in her **first form**, preferring to start the fight by lobbing her **_alchemist's firebomb._** Afterward, she alternates between using her **_multiattack_** to use **_tanglefoot_** and **_thunderstone_**.

When using her **_hail of daggers_**, [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] prefers to target the players instead of [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]. As she fights them, she taunts Father Lucian gleefully, noting, "I'd intended to rip out your throat in front of your cute little congregation, but I guess decorating the church steps with your friends' heads and entrails isn't a bad second place!"

[[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] flees from combat if her first form is reduced to 0 hit points, using her _smokestick_ reaction to escape if possible. (The other **vampire spawn** don't accompany her, and fight to the death.)

When [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] flees, she smashes through a nearby window and gallops across the rooftops like a four-legged beast. As she flees, she snarls, “You think your precious little church can keep you safe? He'll burn down the rest of Vallaki to get to you, and kill the rest of this stinking vermin to force you out!” She then sneers at the players and promises to see them again soon before vanishing from sight behind a chimney.
### 2. Father Lucian
[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] retains the statistics of a **priest**. However, his **_divine eminence_** feature now reads as follows:

- **_Divine Eminence._** As a reaction when he sees another creature within 30 feet hit with a weapon attack, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can expend a spell slot to cause that attack to magically deal an extra 10 (3d6) radiant damage to a target on a hit. If [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

In combat, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] directs the players to form a defensive line around the door, hoping to funnel the vampires one-by-one into a choke point in order to dispatch them individually. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] himself attempts to end his turns behind full cover on each round of combat, ducking out only briefly to target vampires with his offensive spells.

On his first turn, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] uses his action to cast _spirit guardians_, filling the air with a galaxy of swirling, fiery suns that burn with fierce golden light. He stands as near to the front lines as possible while remaining behind full cover, seeking to ensure that any attacking vampire spawn will inevitably be drawn into range of his spell.

On his second turn, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] casts _spiritual weapon_, summoning and attacking with a golden ethereal mace whose head resembles a sunburst—a facsimile of the mace that his ancestor,[[Tasha Petrovna]], once wielded in battle. He then casts _sacred flame_, targeting any vampire that is currently attacking the players.

On his third and subsequent turns, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] uses his action to cast _guiding bolt_ and his bonus action to attack with _spiritual weapon_ once again.

If any of the players are reduced to 0 hit points, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] spends his action casting _cure wounds_ on them. If his concentration is ever disrupted, he spends his action to renew _spirit guardians_ instead.

> [!info]- Dying NPCs 
> Because [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] and her vampire spawn prefer to target the players instead of [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], it's unlikely that [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] will be reduced to 0 hit points in this battle.
> 
> However, as noted in Monsters and Death (Player's Handbook, p. 198), allied non-player characters—such as [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], [[Ireena Kolyana]], and any other NPC fighting alongside the players—should fall unconscious upon being reduced to 0 hit points. When they do, they follow the same rules for death saving throws as player characters, described further in Death Saving Throws (Player's Handbook, p. 197).
### 3. Vampire Spawn
The two **vampire spawn** fight by using their **_claws_** to grapple enemies, who they then drag away to feast upon in private—preferably by hauling grappled prey out of the windows and onto the rooftop of the shop. Both spawn fight to the death.

# D5. Retrieving the Bones
If the players and [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] successfully return the stolen bones to St. Andral’s Church by dawn on Neyavr 7, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] thanks the players and invites [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to remain under their protection for as long as she desires. [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] then sleeps at St. Andral's Church each night until the party departs [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] in [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]].

**_Milestone_**. Restoring the bones of St. Andral completes a story milestone. If the church is successfully reconsecrated, award each player 1,250 XP.

# D6. Rahadin's Visit
At dusk on the first night after the bones have been restored and [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] has assumed power in [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]] or following [[Arc G - The Strazni Siblings]], [[Rahadin]], [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s chamberlain, arrives in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] atop his _phantom steed_. He then commands the town guard to arrest [[Milivoj]] and [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] and bring them to the town square for judgment. (Because of [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s standing orders to obey the laws of [[Castle Ravenloft]]—so long as they do not bring harm to the innocent people of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]—the guards at the gates do not disobey.)

## D6a. The Invitation
---
[[Rahadin]] next rides to the Blue Water Inn or wherever else the players can be found. There, he delivers the players an invitation to dine at [[Castle Ravenloft]], as described in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]], before departing.

Shortly after [[Rahadin]] leaves, a red-faced, sobbing [[Yeska]] approaches the players and pleads with them to quickly come to the town square. [[Milivoj]], he tells them, has been taken prisoner by the town guard, and is set to be executed. ([[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], who has already gone to the town square to call for clemency, sent [[Yeska]] to find and summon the players when [[Milivoj]] was taken from the church grounds.)
## D6b. The Trial
---
When the players arrive in the town square, which is largely as described in N8. Town Square (p. 119), they find a small crowd of onlookers has gathered around the platform holding the empty stocks. Atop the platform stands [[Rahadin]], flanked by two pale-faced [[Vallakians|Vallakian]] **guards**. One of the guards is bending down and arguing with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], who stands at the base of the platform.

On either side of [[Rahadin]] kneel [[Milivoj]] and [[Henrik van der Voort]], their legs and feet bound with rope. [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] is weeping with fear, while [[Milivoj]] is staring vacantly at the ground. Not far away, [[Milivoj]]'s sobbing seven younger siblings, described further in [[#D2. Milivoj's House]], struggle to ascend the platform stairs to reach him as a third **guard** blocks their path.

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] and [[Milivoj]]'s siblings are grateful to see the players upon their arrival. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks the players to help "stop this madness," noting quietly that [[Milivoj]] may have made mistakes, but hardly ones deserving of death.

If confronted, [[Rahadin]] can coldly share that [[Milivoj]] and [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] have been found guilty of crimes against [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and its people.

If the players demand to know which crimes [[Milivoj]] and [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] have committed, or at another suitable point during the proceedings, the crowd parts as [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] arrives, flanked by four **guards** and two **cultists**. [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] then demands [[Rahadin]] inform her of [[Milivoj]] and [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s crimes.
"If the servants of Castle Ravenloft presume to commandeer my guards without my knowledge or permission," she fumes, "I have that right, at least."

> [!cutscene] Rahadin then reads aloud the following proclamation:
> I, Strahd von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia, hereby find Henrik van der Voort of Vallaki GUILTY of the following charges: conspiracy to commit burglary; conspiracy to commit theft; accessory to theft; and receiving stolen property.
> 
> I further find Milivoj of Vallaki GUILTY of the following charges: trespassing, destruction of property, conspiracy to commit burglary, burglary, and theft.
> 
> It is therefore ordered that each receive suitable punishments as befitting the circumstances and nature of their crimes, to be determined and carried out by the Chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft with all reasonable haste.

The proclamation is signed and sealed by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].

As the Chamberlain of [[Castle Ravenloft]], [[Rahadin]] informs the players, he has determined that the sentence for these crimes is death—unless any are willing to speak in the convicted's favour, presenting mitigating circumstances that alleviate the severity of their transgressions. ([[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] will take no action to bar [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s justice, but supports the players in their efforts if friendly toward them.)

Should the players do so, [[Rahadin]] plays the role of an adversarial and cold-hearted judge, pushing back against their responses and probing at the hole in their reasoning. The players might argue the following mitigating circumstances:

- **Henrik:** [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] committed his crimes subject to coercion and duress by [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]], an ostensible agent of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] himself. [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] is also unlikely to commit his crime again, has no criminal history, and committed no violent act against any person. Additionally, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] cooperated with the players when confronted at the coffin-maker's shop.
- **Milivoj:** [[Milivoj]]'s actions were driven by the necessity of his family's poverty, rather than by malice. He was also ignorant of the implications of stealing the bones, and was manipulated by [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] into doing so. Like [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]], he has no criminal history and committed no violent act against any person.

The players can also argue that either character has shown sincere remorse for their actions.

When the players conclude their arguments for each prisoner, they can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check—to attempt to convince [[Rahadin]] to decrease [[Milivoj]] and [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s sentences if their points are at least reasonably well-argued.

The difficulty of convincing [[Rahadin]] to decrease Henrik's sentence is as follows:

- DC 5: [[Rahadin]] agrees to a heavy sentence.
- DC 10: [[Rahadin]] agrees to a moderate sentence.
- DC 15: [[Rahadin]] agrees to a light sentence.
- DC 20: [[Rahadin]] agrees to free Henrik without punishment.

The difficulty of convincing [[Rahadin]] to decrease [[Milivoj]]'s sentence is as follows:

- DC 5: [[Rahadin]] agrees to an extreme sentence.
- DC 10: [[Rahadin]] agrees to a severe sentence.
- DC 15: [[Rahadin]] agrees to a heavy sentence.
- DC 20: [[Rahadin]] agrees to a moderate sentence.

Once the players have convinced [[Rahadin]] to decrease a prisoner's sentence, he then invites the players to suggest a suitable sentence. If the sentence they suggest is too light, he informs them and counters with an alternative suggestion of his own.

Suitable punishments for each sentence include:

- **Extreme.** Life imprisonment in [[Castle Ravenloft]]. ([[Rahadin]] takes the prisoner to the castle dungeons.)
- **Severe.** Mutilation. ([[Rahadin]] removes the prisoner's dominant hand.)
- **Heavy.** Branding. ([[Rahadin]] commands a guard to retrieve and light a torch, which he uses to heat an iron signet ring that bears the image of [[Castle Ravenloft]]—the symbol of his office. He then uses the hot ring to brand the prisoner on the neck.)
- **Moderate.** Flogging. ([[Rahadin]] commands a guard to fetch a whip, then delivers the agreed-upon number of lashes himself.)
- **Light.** A fine. ([[Rahadin]] directs the prisoner to pay a fine of the agreed-upon sum, to be paid to the town coffers. If the prisoner cannot afford to pay it, [[Rahadin]] also sentences him to forced labour in the town's service until he has paid off his debt.)

[[Rahadin]] does not deliver any sentence until all have been agreed upon. If the players prove intransigent or appear to be stalling, [[Rahadin]] warns them that his patience is not infinite, and that he will choose and proceed with a suitable sentence unless the players can provide new evidence—not new arguments—mitigating the severity of the prisoners' crimes. "If any person interferes," he warns, "I will not hesitate to incapacitate them. I answer to none but the master of Castle Ravenloft, and you will not obstruct the exactment of justice this night."

If the players appear horrified by [[Rahadin]]'s chosen sentence, he coldly reminds them that the prisoners have been found guilty of conspiring to steal from a holy church. "My lord's subjects often claim he lacks appreciation for the sacred," he says. "It seems, perhaps, that he is the only one with any appreciation at all."

If the players appear unpersuaded, [[Milivoj]] tells them hoarsely, "Please, don't do anything stupid on my behalf. I did something wrong, and I'll accept any punishment. Just so long as my siblings don't suffer." (If punished with branding, flogging, or mutilation, [[Milivoj]] grits his teeth and stifles a roar of pain, but refuses to cry out and give [[Rahadin]] the satisfaction.)

If any players appear likely to obstruct [[Rahadin]]'s efforts to carry out a sentence, [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] quietly pleads with them not to be foolish. "He is the chamberlain of Castle Ravenloft and Von Zarovich's right hand," she insists. If the players have successfully bartered [[Rahadin]] down from execution, she adds: "You've already saved lives today. Don't trade your own for a doomed endeavor. Vallaki _needs_ you."

If the players actually attempt to obstruct [[Rahadin]]'s efforts to carry out that sentence, he attacks, stopping once those players have been reduced to 0 hit points. Immediately before he delivers the final blow, he intones, "I find you guilty of obstruction of justice—and sentence you accordingly." While the player is unconscious, he then uses his iron signet ring to brand them on the neck with the image of [[Castle Ravenloft]]. He then delivers [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] and [[Milivoj]]'s sentences.

Once [[Rahadin]] is satisfied justice has been done, he summons his _phantom steed_ once more and departs [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] for [[Castle Ravenloft]].

# Design Notes: St. Andral's Feast

**_St. Andral's Church._** The original module's requirement that one of the players be a cleric or paladin to receive this quest has been removed to make it more accessible.

Though it doesn't exist in the original adventure, the holy day of St. Andral's Feast has been added to provide a clear deadline for the players' efforts to recover the bones, and to ensure a safe place for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to stay while the arc unfolds.

The date of the bones' theft has been moved to the night of the players' arrival in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] to ensure that the scene of the crime is sufficiently undisturbed for the players to do substantive detective work while investigating. An assortment of clues has been added to clearly point the finger at [[Milivoj]].

[[Milivoj]] himself has been relocated to his family home—both to show (not tell) his motivation for stealing the bones, to provide dramatic distance between the players' investigation and their confrontation with its prime witness, and to accentuate the appearance of [[Milivoj]]'s guilty conscience.

**_Return to the Church._** [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks to accompany the players to the coffin maker's shop in order to ensure that the party has the benefits of his _spirit guardians_ spell during the fight with [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]]'s **vampire spawn** (i.e., to counteract their regeneration).

**_Arasek Stockyard._** [[Erasmus van Richten|Erasmus]]' ghost has been added to discourage the players from investigating the wagon while also carefully avoiding _encouraging_ them to do it out of spite.

The fresh paint for the Carnival of Wonders sign has been added to intentionally foreshadow that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] (who the players will confront in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]]) is not all that he seems.

**_Coffin Maker's Shop._** [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]]'s two traps have been added to increase the probability that the players do battle with the vampires, thereby introducing them directly to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s minions and the threat posed by vampires. The number of **vampire spawn** has been reduced from six to three, including [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]], to ensure that the encounter is balanced for a 4th-level party.

[[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] has been placed as the mastermind of this scheme in order to provide the players with a low-level boss that they can reasonably defeat—but who will recur as an antagonist throughout the adventure.

[[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]]'s statblock has been designed to provide the players with a dynamic, tactical experience while ensuring that she is not the first of her minions to die.

Meanwhile, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s **_divine eminence_** feature has been modified to allow the players to reap its benefits and ensure that the encounter is not too deadly, as well as to ensure that martial characters without access to magical weapons can deal substantive damage despite the vampires' resistances to nonmagical weapon damage.
