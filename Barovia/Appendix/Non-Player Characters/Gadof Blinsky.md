[[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s toymaker, Gadof Blinsky (CG male human [commoner](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#commoner_mm)), calls himself "a wizard of tiny wonders," but he has been consumed by despair lately because no one seems to like him or want his toys. His fascination for eerie playthings causes most other locals to avoid him. The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] enables Blinsky to stay in business by giving him a couple of gold pieces a month to make festival decorations.

Blinsky is a heavyset man who wears a moth-eaten jester's cap during store hours, more out of habit than to humour visitors. The only paying customer who has set foot in the store recently is a visitor from a faraway land named [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]], who came in the day before the players arrived and bought a stuffed Sabre-toothed Tiger doll.  [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]], observing the toymaker's loneliness, requested if Blinsky would be happy to look after his pet monkey, [[Piccolo]] (use the [baboon](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#baboon_mm) stat block in the [Monster Manual](https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#mm)) while he stayed in town. Overjoyed, Blinsky accepted and has begun training the monkey to fetch toys from hard-to-reach shelves. The toymaker has also fitted [[Piccolo]] with a custom-tailored ballerina tutu.

When he meets new customers, Blinsky recites a well-rehearsed greeting:

"Wyelcome, friends, to the House of Blinsky, where hyappiness and smiles can be bought at bargain prices. Perhaps you know a leetle child in need of joy? A leetle toy for a girl or boy?"

**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** Blinsky should inspire amusement with his accent, attire, and morbid aesthetic, endearment for his loneliness and sincerity, and sympathy for his terror of Izek.

**_Emotions._** Blinsky most often feels cheerful, frightened, anxious, lonely, joyful, or melancholy.

**_Motivations._** Blinsky wants to use his macabre toys to bring joy to Barovia’s children and to succeed Fritz von Weerg as the greatest toymaker of history.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Blinsky, channel Olaf (_Frozen_), Rubeus Hagrid (_Harry Potter_), and Gepetto (_Pinocchio_).

**Character Information**

**_Persona._** To the world, Gadof Blinsky is a cheerful toymaker with a love for the macabre. To those he trusts, Blinsky is a lonely and anxious man, fearful that his work will never be good enough to win his customers’ love.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Blinsky would plead for peace, stumbling over himself and babbling for mercy while looking for an opportunity to flee.

**_Relationships._** Blinsky owns Piccolo, a pet monkey that was given to him by "[[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]", a traveling bard (and one of [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph van Richten]]'s disguises) shortly after his arrival in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. Blinsky also makes dolls resembling [[Ireena Kolyana]] for [[Izek Strazni]], and receives a humble stipend to craft decorations for Baron Vallakovich’s weekly festivals. In addition, Blinsky is the creator of [[Ezmerelda d’Avenir]]'s prosthetic leg.
