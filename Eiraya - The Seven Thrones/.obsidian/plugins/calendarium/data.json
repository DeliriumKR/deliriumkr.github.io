Though she expects to meet with him alone, she welcomes the players' support and assistance if offered.\n\nIf Ireena has already encountered or heard of the Baron’s temperament, she is under no illusions as to the difficulty of winning his favour. However, she is determined to do her best to at least try to help her people—and, as a noble, she is no stranger to the realities of negotiation, compromise, and manipulation.\n\nDuring Ireena’s meeting with the Baron—whether the players are present or not—the Baron dismisses out of hand any suggestion that the refugees be allowed to enter the town. However, he is willing to allow Ireena to come and go from the town into the refugee camp without requiring her to pay the toll at the gates.\n\nIf the players are present at this meeting and befriend or antagonize the Baron, he responds as described in Roleplaying the Vallakovich Family (p. 105). He also boasts to the players of the upcoming Festival of the Blazing Sun, at which he plans to make burned offerings to the Morninglord in a giant wicker sun—cured meats, incense, jewelry, and so on. \"The heavens will see our joy and wealth and look favorably upon us,\" he crows. \"Through our good spirits, we shall move ever-closer to our freedom from this fell darkness.\"",
